# Champo-Carpet-Sales

>This was a project to discover how the company Champo could improve carpet sales. The ultimate ask was to discover how to improve conversion of carpet samples sent to tentative clients into sales. The word doc answers specific questions from an article from the Harvard Business School. Part of the this is the use of Tableau for data visualization and exploration. The ipy file is the work that supports the remainder of the responses in the word doc. The strategy here was to look at the relationship between variables with increasing statistical and machine learning complexity. Accuracy and feature importance are extracted from each method. Subsequently PCA was performed for dimensionality reduction demonstrating 3 clusters explaining the majority of the variance. With this, patterns were realized demonstrating similar feature importance with each model. However, there was a lack of consensus for the third feature. To determine this feature, it needed to be taken into context and appeared to most reasonably depend on the customer's purchasing behaviors and the country from which they are from.
